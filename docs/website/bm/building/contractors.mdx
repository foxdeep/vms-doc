# Description

On the "Contractors" page, users can view a table of "Personnel" associated with the building. They have the ability to filter personnel based on specific conditions or names, perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions for each individual, upload attachments, and receive access codes. By clicking the button (ü§ù) located in the upper-right corner, users can access the "Contractors" dialog box. Within this dialog box, users can apply additional filters based on specific conditions or names, manage contractors using CRUD functions, and upload attachments.

## Open Contractor Dialog

Before creating personnel, it is important to have a contractor in place. To create a contractor, the user can click on the "Contractor" button (ü§ù) located in the upper-right corner, which opens a dialog box. The dialog box displays a table of available contractors, along with a search bar and filter options for finding specific contractors. To add a new contractor, the user can click on the "Add" button (‚ûï).
