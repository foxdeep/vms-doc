# Description

In our "Building" system, we have three main blocks. The "Info" block displays basic information about the building, including a QR code. The "Management Group" block lists the administrators. Finally, the function blocks located below and above the previously mentioned blocks provide links to various features, including "Announcements," "Contractors," "Register Units," "Application Records," "ID Scanners," "Events," and "Settings."
