# Description

To use VMS, users are required to verify their email first. Once verified, users can access their information by clicking on the avatar located on the upper-right corner of the window. This will display a popover menu showing the user's username, role, and email. In addition, users can find options to manage their own information as well as user management below the menu.

## Current user

The "User Info" dialog box allows users to modify their personal information such as:

- User name
- Email address
- Password
