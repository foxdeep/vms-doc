# Description

On the "Form Template" page, users can see four tabs named "General", "Visitor", "Construction", and "Garrison", which represent different types of form templates. These forms are used to collect information from applicants who want to access the building by scanning their access code with Upass, each with a different purpose. Each Form Template will be represented as a ticket in the tenant view.

In each type of Form Template table, users can see the following columns:

- "Create Type": This column indicates whether the form template was created by the user or if it is a system default template. If it is a "system default" template, the user cannot modify the content of the form or delete it; they can only modify the name of the form template.
- "Release Status": This column indicates whether the form template has been released to tenants or not.
- "Name"
- "Create Time"

#### Approval Management

Before releasing the form template, it is important to set up the approval flow. Users can easily configure how many people should approve a ticket before it can be closed.

If the clique is a tenant, the applicant will assign the approver during ticket creation. In this case, the user only needs to assign the approver for each stage of the approval flow. It's worth noting that for stages that belong to BM, the BM needs to choose a user who will act as the approver for that stage. In addition, the BM needs to assign the appropriate permission role for the approver, which can be either admin or regular user. This will ensure that the approval flow operates smoothly and efficiently.

#### Attachment Management

Once a ticket is approved, users can upload any relevant attachments that tenants can then download. This allows tenants to access any necessary documents or files associated with the ticket, providing them with the information they need to proceed with their request.
